# Airbnb-Analysis-and-Simple-Modeling
This is a short  project provided by Springboard's free course Introduction to Business Analytics. 
The data from Airbnb features four markets (Amsterdam, Austin, New York, and Taipei).

**The following is a list of concepts explored and programs used:"**
- Excel
  - PivotTables
  - SUMIFS()
- Statistics
  - Descriptive statistics, such as: average, counts, etc.
  - Inferential statistics, such as: correlation, simple linear regression, etc.
- Modeling

This short project also answers the following questions:
- 1. What is the average listing price per market?
- 2. What is the property type distribution per market?
- 3. Is there a correlation between average host response time and number of reviews?
- 4. Is there a correlation between average rating and cleaning fee?
- 5. Based on yearly profits, what is the most attractive market for new host listings?
- 5. How many listings per city are making more than the average profit per city?

Note to reader: 
This is an __extremely__ rudimentary introduction to business analysis and should be treated as such. There is space for further exploration of the nuances of the question prompts. I will update the files as I gain more knowledge. 

Another note:
I really like box and whisker plots to convey distributions. Unfortunately, my version of Excel (Mac 2011) doesn't have a proprietary ability to do so. BUT, I will follow the way Peltier makes a box and whisker plot (https://peltiertech.com/excel-box-and-whisker-diagrams-box-plots/).
