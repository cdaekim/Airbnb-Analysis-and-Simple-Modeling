# Airbnb-Analysis-and-Simple-Modeling
This is a short project provided by Springboard's free course Introduction to Business Analytics. The data from Airbnb features four markets (Amsterdam, Austin, New York, and Taipei). 

**The following is a list of concepts explored and program/skills used:**
- Excel
  - PivotTables
  - SUMIFS()
  - IFERROR()
  - OR()
  - RANK()
  - Scatter plots
- Statistics
  - Descriptive statistics, such as: average, counts, IQR, etc.
  - Inferential statistics, such as: correlation, simple linear regression, etc.
- Modeling

This short project also answers the following questions:
- What is the average listing price per market?
- What is the property type distribution per market?
- Is there a correlation between average host response time and number of reviews?
- Is there a correlation between average rating and cleaning fee?
- How many listings per city are making more than the average profit per city? Based on yearly profits, what is the most attractive market for new host listings? 
- Plus my own questions and explorations that I found were interesting when I was analyzing the data.

**RESULTS**

The answers to the questions are provided in the report that is also available in the repository. 

**EXTRA DATA**

Links of the comparison of the cost of living are below:

The data for population density was not available in the original dataset, so I extracted the values from the links below:

Note to reader: 
This is an __extremely__ rudimentary introduction to business analysis and should be treated as such. There is space for further exploration of the nuances in the question prompts. I will update the files as I gain more knowledge. Seeing that the data set is limited and already preset as an introduction to financial analysis, the amount of analysis in this project will also be limited.
